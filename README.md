We are Ryan Hecht, Raghu Nimmagadda, Jonghyun Lee, and Isaac Benghiat,
a group of first-year Brown students participating in our very first Hackathon.


Memeaction was born from the idea that a picture is worth a thousand words--and gif's are made up of multiple
pictures, so what better way to convey the nuance of emotion than through this information-dense medium?


Take a picture conveying your current mood--happy, sad, angry, or maybe something in between. We'll serve you
up four gifs that will perfectly match your mood!


Memeaction utilizes the Microsoft Cognitive Services Emotion API to resolve emotions, and MIT Media Lab's gif.gf for
gif sourcing (and gyphy when gif.gf did not have emotional gif data). The project is hosted on Microsoft Azure, and
features a node.js backend. Materialize is used for frontend design.


This is our first time working with all of the node stack, as well as our first time using Azure. Other technologies learned
throughout the development of this project include cjs and dynamic HTML, sending binary data over the network, and some really
cool node packages! (Also, two of our team members learned HTML and CSS for the very first time!)
